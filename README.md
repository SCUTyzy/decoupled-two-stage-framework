This project is the source code for the paper edtitled “FPCB Surface Defect Detection: A Decoupled Two-Stage Object Detection Framework”. We will upload the source code after the paper is publicly published.

The code is not allowed directly due to the lack of some dependencies.
You can finetune the code, using torch's functions to implement some of the details.

FPCB-DET dataset is collected from a commercial company.
Therefore, FPCB-DET dataset is limited to academic use！！！Prohibited for any commercial use！！！ 

If you need FPCB-DET dataset to do some research, please contact us. After review and permission by the commercial company, we will provide the dataset to you.
